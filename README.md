## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character discovers a hidden letter or object in the walls of the old house, revealing a secret about the mother.
- Draft a monologue from Emilio's perspective, decades earlier, as he first stakes his claim on the cliff's edge.
- Imagine a chapter from the point of view of the local cement supplier, caught between Lorenzo's demands and his own survival.
- Write a 'deleted scene' of a conversation Soledad has with a gallery owner in Madrid, where she tries to explain the art she's selling and thinks of the concrete skeleton back home.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a simple web-based 'Structural Integrity Calculator' where users input variables (cement grade, rebar spacing, wind load) to see if Emilio's house would theoretically stand.
- Create a 'Generational Dialogue Map' visualization tool that charts the frequency and tone of spoken exchanges between Lorenzo, Soledad, and Emilio across the 24 chapters.
